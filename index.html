                <h2>How It Started</h2>
                <p>Born in the backyard of his adopted-family’s relative, with a brother and a sister,<br>
                    Joey didn’t always live a life of luxury. When he was just a few months old, the <br>
                    Levinsons took him in and accepted him as one of their own, spoiling him with a life <br>
                    of comfy beds and unlimited food. Upon taking him home, it was a struggle for the <br>
                    Levinsons to choose his name. It had to fit his personality and his looks. It had to be <br>
                    him. Oreo? Ninja? None of it seemed quite right, but when he playfully stood on his tiny <br>
                    hind legs like a baby kangaroo, they knew Joey was the <em>purrfect</em> name for him.</p>
